This is a copy of varnish-2.1.2el5 that has been patched for use at
Livejournal.  The relevant code is in 
    bin/varnishd/cache_center.c

other changes are for version identification.

Just before the vcl_fetch() routine is called, all of the headers are
examined and the value fields of all of the Set-Cookie headers are
concatenated together.  The value fields are separated by a known
separator string, and copied into an header named 'X-Set-Cookies'.
The X header can be referenced in the vcl_fetch() routine like this
(for instance):

    vcl_fetch() {

        
       if (beresp.http.X-Set-Cookies != "error") {
           ## Remove ljuniq and ljfsads Set-Cookies 
           set beresp.http.X-Set-Cookies-Sent = beresp.http.X-Set-Cookies;
       }

    }

If an error arises during the execution of the patch, the
X-Set-Cookies header will have the value 'error'.  If there are no
Set-Cookie headers in the backend response then the X-Set-Cookies
header will not exist.  After the vcl_fetch() routine runs, the
X-Set-Cookies header will be removed if it exists.


these commands can be useful:

    $ cd varnish-cache
    $ git archive --format=tar --prefix=varnish-cache/ varnish-2.1.2lja | gzip > ../varnish-2.1.2lja.tar.gz
